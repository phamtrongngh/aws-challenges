# Location Tracker System 

## Overview
As an AWS SA of **iCar** - a car rental startup - you are required to design and develop a location tracker system that can track the geolocation of thousands of car GPS devices in real-time. The cars are rented out to customers who can use the iCar web app to track the location of the car they have rented. 

## Requirements:
1. The system should be able to track the location of thousands of cars in real-time.
2. The system should be able to store the location data of the cars for at least 30 days.
3. The system should be able to provide the location data of a car to the iCar web app in real-time.

## Non-Functional Requirements:
1. The system should be highly available.
2. The system should be scalable.
3. The system should be secure.


## High-Level Architecture
### GPS Device in Cars:
Each car is equipped with a GPS device that sends location data at regular intervals.

### Data Ingestion Layer:
Use AWS IoT Core to handle the ingestion of location data from thousands of GPS devices. AWS IoT Core can manage device connections, message processing, and integration with other AWS services.

### Data Processing Layer:
Use AWS Lambda or AWS Kinesis Data Streams to process incoming data in real-time. \
Optionally, use AWS Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time analytics and filtering.

### Data Storage:
Store processed location data in a scalable database like Amazon DynamoDB for quick read/write access. \
Use Amazon S3 for long-term storage and historical data analysis.

### Backend API:
Develop a backend API using AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda or Amazon ECS/Fargate running a microservice application. \
This API will allow the web app to fetch the latest location data for a specific car.

### Web Application:
Develop a web app using a modern frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that communicates with the backend API to fetch and display car locations on a map (using libraries like Leaflet or Google Maps).
## Detailed Steps
1. GPS Device and AWS IoT Core
GPS Device: Ensure each car has a GPS device capable of sending geolocation data (latitude, longitude, timestamp) over a cellular network to the internet.
AWS IoT Core:
Register each GPS device as a "thing" in AWS IoT.
Create a topic for publishing location data (e.g., car/{carId}/location).
Use IoT Rules to route data to AWS services (e.g., Lambda, Kinesis).
2. Data Processing
AWS Lambda:
Create a Lambda function to process incoming data from AWS IoT.
Validate and enrich data (e.g., add metadata, calculate additional information like speed).
Store processed data in DynamoDB or forward to Kinesis for further processing.
AWS Kinesis:
Use Kinesis Data Streams for real-time processing if needed.
Use Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time analytics (e.g., detect anomalies, calculate aggregates).
3. Data Storage
Amazon DynamoDB:
Design a table schema for storing car location data with efficient querying capabilities.
Example schema:
Partition key: carId
Sort key: timestamp
Attributes: latitude, longitude, speed, etc.
Amazon S3:
Set up an S3 bucket for storing historical location data.
Use AWS Glue for data cataloging and ETL processes if needed.
4. Backend API
AWS API Gateway:
Create an API Gateway to expose RESTful endpoints for the web app.
Integrate API Gateway with Lambda functions or ECS/Fargate services.
Backend Service:
Implement API endpoints to fetch current and historical location data.
Example endpoints:
GET /cars/{carId}/location - fetch the latest location.
GET /cars/{carId}/locations?start={start}&end={end} - fetch location history within a time range.
5. Web Application
Frontend Framework:
Develop the web app using a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
Implement user authentication and authorization (e.g., using Amazon Cognito).
Map Integration:
Integrate a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps) to display car locations.
Fetch location data from the backend API and update the map in real-time.
Security and Monitoring
Security:
Use AWS IAM roles and policies to control access to AWS resources.
Ensure data is encrypted in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using AWS KMS).
Monitoring:
Set up CloudWatch for monitoring AWS IoT, Lambda, and other services.
Use CloudWatch Alarms for alerting on anomalies or failures.
Implement logging using CloudWatch Logs or other logging solutions.
Scalability and Reliability
Scalability:
Use auto-scaling for AWS Lambda and ECS services.
Design DynamoDB tables with proper partition keys to handle large-scale data.
Reliability:
Implement retries and error handling for data ingestion and processing.
Use AWS CloudFront for CDN if serving the web app globally.
