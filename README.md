## Introduction
If you are new to AWS or want to have hands-on experience with AWS services, you are in the right place. \
This repository contains a collection of AWS labs which are designed to be simple and easy to follow. Each lab has a scenario, steps, and cleanup instructions. You can follow the steps to complete the lab and learn about AWS services.

## Prerequisites
Labs in this repository assume that you have an AWS account and basic knowledge of AWS services. It's designed for those who want to practice and hands-on with AWS services.

> Note that **"for Kids"** just a fun way to say that these labs are designed for everyone. Don't worry if you are not a kid, you can still follow the labs and learn AWS. :) 

## Notes
- Labs in this repository might use AWS resources that are not covered under the AWS Free Tier. Please check the pricing of the services before starting the lab.
- Make sure to clean up the resources after completing the lab to avoid any unexpected charges.
- Most of the labs interact with AWS services using the AWS CLI for simplicity and consistency. You can use the AWS Management Console if you prefer.
